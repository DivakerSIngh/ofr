                    The reservation holder must present a valid photo ID and credit card at check-in.

                    In connection with facilitating your hotel transaction when onefinerate charges your card, the charge to your payment method will include a charge for Taxes and Service Fees. This charge includes an estimated or anticipated amount to recover the amount we pay to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the hotel including, without limitation, sales and value added tax and/or other similar taxes. The amount paid to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we estimate and include, in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Service Fees is a fee we retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs. The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount we pay the hotel and the location of the hotel where you will be staying, and may include profit that we retain.
                </p>
                <p> Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location.<br />For transactions involving hotels located within certain jurisdictions, the amount charged to you for Taxes and Service Fees includes a payment of tax that we are required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts we retain as compensation for our services.</p><p>
                    Depending on the property you stay at you may also be charged for certain optional incidental fees, for example, parking charges, minibar charges, phone calls, room service and movie rentals, etc. These charges, if applicable, will be payable by you to the hotel directly in local currency at checkout. When you check in, a credit card or, in the hotel's discretion, a debit card will be required to secure these charges and fees that you may incur during your stay. Please contact the hotel directly as to whether and which charges or service fees apply.
